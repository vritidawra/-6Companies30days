Number of Boomerangs
https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-boomerangs/
You are given n points in the plane that are all distinct, where points[i] = [xi, yi]. A boomerang is a tuple of points (i, j, k) such that the distance between i and j equals the distance between i and k (the order of the tuple matters).

Return the number of boomerangs.Â 

Example 1:

Input: points = [[0,0],[1,0],[2,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The two boomerangs are [[1,0],[0,0],[2,0]] and [[1,0],[2,0],[0,0]].






SOLUTION
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfBoomerangs(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
        int ans=0;
        for(auto it1:points){
            unordered_map<double,int> mp;
            auto x1 = it1[0];
            auto y1 = it1[1];
            for(auto it2:points){
                if(it1 == it2) continue;                
                auto x2 = it2[0];
                auto y2 = it2[1];
                int xdist = (x1 - x2) * (x1 - x2);
                int ydist = (y1 - y2) * (y1 - y2);                
                double finalDist = sqrt(xdist + ydist);                
                mp[finalDist]++;
            }
            for(auto &i : mp) 
				if(i.second > 1)   ans += (i.second * (i.second-1)); 
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
